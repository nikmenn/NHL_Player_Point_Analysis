# NHL_Player_Point_Analysis
Looking into Joe Thornton's stats in the 2009-2010 season

This project utilizes the NHLscrapi. It creates a csv of an individual player's game by game point totals (including what team they played against for a specific season). You can view the specific arguments needed for the function to run by using help(point_counter). It outputs a csv file in the same directory you ran the program in.

In the 'Joe Thornton' folder, I used the CSV file I created with said function and used it to look a bit closer at Joe Thornton's point totals in the 2009-2010 NHL season. In that season he had 89 points in 79 regular season games but in the playoffs he had 12 points in 15 games. Because of the much lower point per game value in the playoffs compared to his regular season, he is often labelled as a 'playoff choker.' I looked into it in a bit more detail (in 'Thornton_Points_Analysis.ipynb') and found out that him having a playoff point per game rate like that is something you could expect for a player with his regular season point point per game rate.
